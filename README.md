# Stock Price Prediction üìà

## Overview

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical market data using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. It analyzes stock trends, applies predictive models, and provides insights for informed decision-making.

## Features

- Predicts future stock prices based on historical trends.
- Uses multiple ML models for accurate forecasting.
- Visualizes stock price movements and patterns.
- Compares the performance of different predictive models.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python üêç
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock market data, including:

- **Date & Time:** Timestamp of each entry.
- **Open & Close Prices:** Prices at the start and end of the trading session.
- **High & Low Prices:** Maximum and minimum stock prices in a day.
- **Volume:** Number of shares traded.

## Machine Learning Models Used

1. **Linear Regression** ‚Äì A simple statistical model for stock trend prediction.
2. **Random Forest** ‚Äì An ensemble learning method that improves accuracy.
3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** ‚Äì A deep learning model effective for time-series forecasting.
4. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** ‚Äì A statistical model used for trend analysis.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Importing stock market datasets from sources like Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Handling missing values and normalizing the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Visualizing stock price trends and correlations.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** ‚Äì Training ML models and measuring performance using RMSE & R¬≤ scores.
5. **Predictions & Visualization** ‚Äì Forecasting stock prices and comparing actual vs. predicted trends.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Expected Outcome

- A predictive model capable of forecasting stock prices.
- Graphical representations of stock trends.
- Market insights based on historical data.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing **Reinforcement Learning** for better decision-making.
- Adding **Sentiment Analysis** on financial news to improve predictions.
- Developing a **real-time stock price prediction dashboard**.
